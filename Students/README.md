# MACS 40200: Students assignment folder #

This folder `/StructEst_W18/Students/` is where you will submit your problem sets and project assignments via pull request (PR). However, I will not merge those PR's into this repository. But I will close them when I have graded them.

The directory structure of your problem sets should have the following structure. The example is your writeup of your results from Problem Set 3.

`/StructEst_W18/Students/YourGitHubHandle/PS3/PS3.pdf`

The idea is for you to have a `Students` folder that has a subfolder named after your GitHub handle (`YourGitHubHandle`). This is for my sake in keeping track of everything. Then you are to have a subfolder for every assignment, within which subfolder you place all of your supporting documents and writeups.
